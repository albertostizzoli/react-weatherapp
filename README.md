## Technologies Used

- REACT JS: Javascript Library open source for building user interface. It is based on the concept of components, which are reusable blocks of code that represent a part of the user interface. Each component can manage its own state and react to changes in data (state or properties). 

- TAILWIND: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes to quickly build custom designs without writing many lines of CSS code, Tailwind lets you compose your design directly in the HTML markup using classes to set colors, spacing, typography, layout, and more.

- AXIOS: Axios is a JavaScript library that lets you make HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more, in a simple and concise way. It is based on Promises, which means it easily supports asynchronous operations, making your code more readable and maintainable, especially when working with server or API requests. With Axios, you can send requests to servers and receive responses in JSON (or other) format, and easily handle errors and responses. It also offers features such as HTTP header handling, request cancellation, and support for sending data in JSON or form-encoded format.

- FRAMER-MOTION: Framer Motion is a JavaScript library for animation in React. It is designed to simplify the implementation of complex animations in a declarative and fluid way, making it easy to add transitions, animations, and interactions to your user interfaces. With Framer Motion, you can animate React components by applying properties like position, opacity, scale, and more, and manage the behavior of the animations dynamically. The library supports event-based animations like mouse movement or clicks, and also includes features like sequence animations, smooth transitions, and layout animations.

- CHART JS: Chart.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily create interactive and customizable charts. It is widely used to display data in graphical format, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, radar charts, and many other types of charts. Chart.js uses HTML5 canvas to draw charts, and with its easy-to-use API, you can easily configure options such as colors, labels, legends, axes, and animations. The library also supports dynamic chart updating, which makes it useful for displaying real-time data.
